1. When the UI opens, all objects should be static
2. Only when an objective is entered in textbox and returned, all objects go to initialized place
3. After "Start" button clicked, simulation starts

How "start" button works:
- when clicked, reset all count and positions, trigger proceeding simulation step
- when clicked again at any moment, the same action above will be done again
